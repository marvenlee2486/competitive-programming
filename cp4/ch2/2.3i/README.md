Use policy-based Data structures (pbds) - Tree.. 
The reason cannot use set to maintain is because we need to access the position of the item.
Set does not provide O(log n) access by index or get index as the binary tree does not stores size of subtree ... 
ALTHOUGH CAN USED DISTANCE, but that is O(n) is too long.

PBDS does stores size so can access by index or get index by O(log n). 
!!!!

Then another learning outcome is use the bool comparator . But due to unknown reason, it have to be that format.
